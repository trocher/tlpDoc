\subsection{Logarithmic lower bound the round elimination}
We know that when using the round elimination \cite{round-eliminator}, finding a fixed point in a speed up on a problem $\Pi$ result in $\Pi$ having a $\Omega(log(n))$ lower bound on its complexity. Unfortunately, the round eliminator does not includes an automatic detection of such fixed points. We hence ran the auto lower bound tools with $iterations = 16$ and $labels = 5$. Whenever the round eliminator would return a lower bound of 17 round, it was very likely that it was a fixed point and was manually checked to produce this list of the easiest unclassified problems that got a fixed point.

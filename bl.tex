A complete complexity classification of the problems using 1 or 2 labels already exists \cite{1}. In the case of the problems that are using 3 labels theses result will be useful in two ways :
\begin{itemize}
    \item It provide some useful upper bounds for relaxations of theses problems that are using 3 labels.
    \item As we will see, some 3-labelling problems can be reduced to 2-labelling problems since they some of the labels are in fact redundant.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Redundant labels}
The idea here is that in some problems with $|A_{\Pi}|=3$, we could remove every configuration that use a label $l_i$ without changing the complexity of the problem.\\
In order to do that, there must be a label $l_j\neq l_i$ such that for every configuration $c=(x_{l_1},x_{l_2},x_{l_3})$ using $l_i$, there must exists another configuration $c'=(x_{l_1'},x_{l_2'},x_{l_3'})$ such that : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $l_i'=0$
    \item $l_j'= l_j+l_i$
    \item $l_k' = l_k$ where $ k = \Sigma \setminus \{l_i,l_j\}$ 
\end{itemize}
In other word, each time a node is using a configuration using $l_i$ it could safely switch to a similar configuration using $l_j$ instead of $l_i$. Hence it appear that if we remove all the configurations using $l_i$ the new binary labelling problem obtained will have the same complexity since $l_i$ was redundant.
\begin{exmp}
Let $\Pi$ be the following problem with $\wdd = 3$ and $\bdd = 2$ :
\begin{itemize}
    \item $W = ABB, BBC, BCC, CCC, AAA, BBB, ACC, ABC$
    \item $B = AC, AB$
\end{itemize}
Can be described as :
Let's show that C is redundant in this problem and can be replaced by B:\\\\
In the black constraint, $AC$ is the only configuration using $C$, we can use $AB$ instead (the $C$ is replaced by $B$\\
In the white constraint :
\begin{itemize}
    \item $BB\textbf{C} \rightarrow BB\textbf{B}$
    \item $B\textbf{CC} \rightarrow B\textbf{BB}$
    \item $\textbf{CCC} \rightarrow \textbf{BBB}$
    \item $A\textbf{CC} \rightarrow A\textbf{BB}$
    \item $AB\textbf{C} \rightarrow AB\textbf{B}$
\end{itemize}
We can see that each new configuration obtained by replacing $C$ by $B$ is indeed in the black constraint.\\
We can now construct a binary labelling problem $\Pi'$ equivalent to $\Pi$ :\\
$\Pi'=(3,\bdd,W',B')$ with :
\begin{itemize}
    \item $W' = ABB, AAA, BBB$
    \item $B' = AB$
\end{itemize}
W' and B' being W and B minus all the configurations using $C$

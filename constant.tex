By using round-elimination \cite{round-eliminator}, we are able to get constants upper bounds on a lot of problems. The round-eliminator can prove that a given problem must have a constant complexity, however, a problem for which the round-eliminator does not find a constant upper bound can also be constant.\\\\
In the case $\wdd = 3$, $\bdd = 2$, and using the command:
\begin{lstlisting}
server autoub -f problem --iter 9 --labels 3
\end{lstlisting}
We obtains the followings results on the problem dataset :
\begin{itemize}
    \item 0 rounds : 5414 problems
    \item 1 rounds : 761 problems
    \item 2 rounds : 89 problems
    \item 3 rounds : 65 problems
    \item 4 rounds : 9 problems
\end{itemize}

\section{The round eliminator}
Before going any further, we will reduce the database set by removing from it a lot of constant problems.
By using round-elimination \cite{round-eliminator}, we are able to get constant upper bounds on a lot of problems. The round-eliminator can prove that a given problem must have a constant complexity, however, a problem for which the round-eliminator does not find a constant upper bound can also be constant.

Since the time and resources needed by the round eliminator are increasing with the \textit{iterations} and \textit{labels} parameters, we run the round eliminator on the set of unclassified problem by iteration while increasing the parameters each time.

\section{Results}
With $\wdd = 3$, $\bdd = 2$, and by using the auto upper bound functionality of the tool, we manage to classify 6472 constant problems with the following distribution on their upper bound.
\begin{itemize}
    \item 0 rounds : 5414 problems
    \item 1 rounds : 761 problems
    \item 2 rounds : 65 problems
    \item 3 rounds : 138 problems
    \item 4 rounds : 16 problems
    \item 5 rounds : 37 problems
    \item 6 rounds : 15 problems
    \item 7 rounds : 15 problems
    \item 8 rounds : 8 problems
    \item 9 rounds : 3 problems
\end{itemize}

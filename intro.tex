In a previous work \cite{1} the class of binary labelling problem has been defined and classified according to the problem's complexity. This work aims to extend this classification to a larger class: the ternary labelling problems. The classification is not complete and focuses on ternary problems that have degrees $\wdd = 3$, $\bdd = 2$ even if a lot of the work done can also be applied to higher degrees. With this documentation, a classifier has been implemented (\hyperlink{https://github.com/trocher/tlpClassifier}{https://github.com/trocher/tlpClassifier}). Despite classifying problems, it also allows to look for a problem and its complexity. This work will show what the classifier is doing and prove its correctness.
